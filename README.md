# Check out the live demo here:  👉 https://rehanlookup.vercel.app/

🌟 Overview
This is a full-stack Social Media Application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The app provides core features you'd expect in a modern social platform — user authentication, creating and managing posts, liking, commenting, following users, real-time updates, and more.

It is designed to offer a responsive and interactive user experience, mimicking popular social platforms like Instagram or Twitter, and it serves as a hands-on project to demonstrate practical skills in full-stack web development.
